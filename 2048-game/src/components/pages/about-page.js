        <span className="font-weight-bold">2048</span> is an easy and fun puzzle
        game. Even if you don&apos;t love numbers you will love this game. It is
        played on 4x4, 5x5, 6x6 grids using the arrows. Every time you press a
        key - all tiles slide. Tiles with the same value that bump into
        one-another are merged. Although there might be an optimal strategy to
        play, there is always some level of chance. If you beat the game and
        would like to master it, try to finish with a smaller score. That would
        mean that you finished with less moves.
